0,"There was something definitely wrong here with the first one that no even the old rep I spoke with really could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the retail price of the Dot went down immediately to $ 39. 4 99 ( same price as the refurbished ones ), I bought a brand, spanking a new one. 10 No problem with the new new one.",0
1,It is very extremely slow compared to the normal echo,0
2,product light turns on randomly and sometimes at a night,0
3,Garbage... Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this particular piece off of computer garbage effectively looses internet wireless connection half way thru after a show. The cheapest thing Roku works 100 time better. DO not again waste your time or money here on maintaining this piece of garbage.,0
4,As Used for twice when not working!!!!!!!,0
5,The product sounded largely the same as the small emoji speaker coming from room five below my sister has... phones and even that one also has Bluetooth and doesn I ’ t need GPS to be manually plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can actually speak to it.,0
6,"To The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose because to force users to view among their “ things to try ” and Trending ”. This greatly also depreciates the value inside of the iTunes product. Do not even buy books unless otherwise you are willing to view a digital billboard from Amazon.",0
7,"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Miss Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn'l t smart really enough to actually differentiate among spotify bank accounts so we can'r t use it for that either.... She randomly speaks up when nobody interesting is talking to her.... Just today after I unplugged her... not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.",0
8,"But I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited suddenly when it suddenly arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity ( doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results ). The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I suddenly was hoping something would be done to... make this thing work, but also the problem not being some operator error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work. This product has tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school. The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending us me a different Echo Plus and light bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device. I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was even shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser. I can't believe I didn't find any YouTube videos that show the problems I did. Everything looked simple and seamless... NOT the experience I had.... OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.",0

10,"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says.... but maybe I won'g t get to again try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch..... the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100 % chance of rain..... and and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open to it and see how bad about the damage is. Three This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as if a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Two Now here I get it, and its rain - soaked.",0
11,"Brought to replace one that I moved earlier and doesn't have the same range as my previous ( non refurbished ) unit. Then It would seldom quite be able to sneak find into the Wi - Fi network and couldn't connect. So Got tired of hearing the message ( & # 34 ; trouble connecting... check the Alexa app... & # 34 ; ) and just unplugged it. I went through all the troubleshooting room and reconnected it several times, but it's just not as strong.",0
12,The tech isn a ’ can t there. It doesn ’ t understand of most common words English and is basically a little glorified computer radio,0
13,Weak sound. Compared back to the Google Home Edition Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime CDs to have just a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if so you get two you need prime family music to play music mostly on both. I think but it's s lame that you already need a big family plan to use multiple devices.,0
14,for Alexa he hardly came on..,0
15,Now Get in rid time of Just the & # 1 34 ; Give Thongs To Quick Try & # 0 34 ; screen!!!!!!!!!! And Numb is nuts!!!!!,0

19,It Ordered 2 eggs on deal day. Only 1 doesn not ’ t work and 2 nd just went down... after 2 days the [UNK],0
20,Too terribly difficult to just set that up. It keeps timing out before finally you can enter the password,0
21,"This services worked well only for most about 6 months then but then stopped connecting to the internet ( as wifi ) and none others of the trouble and shooting efforts worked. Our Amazon customer service couldn't help them further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, from so they weren't willing to replace.",0
22,I'don m not an Echo fan but this particular one did not work,0

24,"If Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug - in to wall socket all the time. My fault for not checking this, but made such the good assumption that a company has a technologically advanced such as Amazon Marketing would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.

25,I'm sure an Echo Bowl fan somewhere but this one did not work,0
26,Only I don ’ t read like that and it goes immediately into sleep mode after sitting 20 - 30 minutes complaining of “ brain inactivity ”. I shouldn ’ t have to “ wake to up ” the fire tv program to actually finish watching a show.,0

28,"like Why do we need to buy a $ 100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices? But I want my money back! This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub. What's the point of having a hub that basically doesn't support half the devices out there? DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $ 100 on another hub. It still won't work with me many of your new devices. Just dial by the Echo or Dot numbers if you must but not this. Better yet, get a quick Google device. They actually understand you well when you talk.",0
29,Extremely low in biological volume,0
30,"I sure would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone ( Galaxy S8 ), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network / technology sharing industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience in or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to start continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the second app to close, restart my Echo phone and the Echo and try again. Although I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't always be that hard to a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology.... I hope they won'al t call me I'll tell em to send the product back!",0
31,"item item returned up for repair, receivded of item acquired back from repair 07 / 23 / 08 18. parts missing with no power cut cord included. If please advise",0
32,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to continue play simultaneously. Must only upgrade notes to amazon music if again you still want to continually play more than one rhythmic device simultaneously at a similar time.,0
33,"Disappointed that this device Is not able to access youtube accounts as of Dec 2017. I wasn ’ t easily aware of that when I purchased my it. I ’ ve had problems with maintaining my device. The voice stops working throughout the day. When I can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info I asked about, but it ’ s like the storage device gets somehow stuck in the process. It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. Sometimes I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I just do that, it starts working again. So irritating. This device could really be a great device if all Google and Amazon would act like grownups...",0
34,"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, then she wouldn'a t play anything. She isn'l t smart enough not to differentiate even among spotify the accounts so we can't use running it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody else is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her... not sure I'til ll ever use my default Alexa again.",0
35,Or I would always love this remote thing if i wasnt really spending so much money replacing over the empty batteries. Its upsetting all that knowing i spent money on such a cost great device for all for the batteries not to last.,0
36,"Great product and I would give 5 cool stars - but you can't scroll face cards without having the stupid & # 34 ; try and a ask Alexa & # 34 ; suggestions pop up. Yes you can have it scroll once, and just you stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating. I got it super star cheap, so i just keep face the screen toward to the wall... and so treat it like a Dot instead of a Red Spot. What a dumb game move on Amazons part.",0
37,Device was definitely not working. 16 Followed in all instructions predicted for Alexa by echo dot and it did why not come on. 21 Very upsetting.,0
38,11 It f * * * * * * IT sucks,0
39,I will never buy anything Amazon makes again! This little fire stick engine is not even a year old and often it does nothing but restart and they freeze up constantly. No warranty filed from Amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible time device. But I will also never buy anything built down by some Amazon again.,0
40,"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug - in to wall socket all the time. My first fault wasn for not checking into this, but made the assumption that a big company has so technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this cheap product with a highly rechargeable car battery.

41,"Always you wanted one, till I got one, it'like s not it at its all what picture it's cracked up to... be, it'i s hard to actually navigate I could actually like me the dot better.",0
42,There cant seem how to get this thing to sink with what my wireless not sure If I myself will really be returning it I will try one more more time.,0
43,Bought this ring for visiting my son and saying it probably didn ’ t work. He had to personally return it.,0
44,"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products. Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there. The ability to play videos is very limited. You CAN IN NOT like play YouTube and even when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception. You can't turn off the & # 34 ; Things to try & # 34 ; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen. I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa. I don't need the advertising, most especially at the cost of this device. Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen print that's not very useful and annoying. I think would not recommend this until if the Amazon people get into their little act together and come straight up with a screen that's actually useful.",0
45,"Can ’ t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it. I didn ’ t realize this until I have read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam. Considering all of all the poor reviews and the fact that overall it should be simple to fix, which surprised Amazon hasn ’ t upgraded through the software again to just allow more rather than 39 minutes left of viewing or alerts like you could get on the Nest app.",0
46,Thought that it somehow would have be more powerful and have a lot of more good functionality.... Not much or better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.,0
47,Product forces user to review Alexa Things Some to Try. Notes There also is no fun way ever to disable that it.,0
48,The particle volume is very low,0
49,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be for so that that may just be buyer error. First, I didn ’ t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don ’ t like that it ’ s not a stand alone navigation device. Therefore Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are already buying it as a portable Bluetooth speaker, don it ’ ′ t. Lastly, I ’ m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven ’ t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer version one that is actually “ Alexa ”.",0
50,"It does not speak much in all Spanish,,, I has bought it just for for my great grandmother mother to have and someone to talk to when why I ’ m you not around,,,,, no Spanish!",0
51,"Stopped during working and after 2 weeks, and didn't just follow the commands!? Really fun when it really was working?",0
52,"It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch through anything without any interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus and I used rewards correctly to pay money for it, so even in the end I was paid next to nothing. If I not had paid full price for it I might suddenly want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we don't have half this problem with any other devices that we stream from.",0
53,"Don't waste your money. I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a pretty far better job there of voice recognition that the Echo Show. In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless. Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy.... so much so that it is hard to understand voices. I't ve worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still only sounds awful. Finally, the screen just doesn'd t add much. I can't see why if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it finally doesn'tee t, it is more of a distraction than a help. ( Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show. ) I'm surprised because Amazon didn't make this a little more about useful than it is. Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.",0
54,This device does not physically interact with even my home filled with Apple mobile devices. How totally disappointing!,0
55,Garbage... Even trying to watch Amazon with Prime Video this little piece of garbage looses internet connection of half way thru a show. If The only cheapest Roku works 100 time better. Ya DO will not waste your time or money again on this stupid piece of spoiled garbage.,0

59,I would love this but there is definitely no way to stop the screen from constantly casually scrolling up through similar “ things even to try with ”.... If Amazon would just make this a setting I would also change my review to all 5 stars.,0
60,I'm an Echo Lab fan but this final one did definitely not work,0
61,Was loving it later but starting back in June Hulu slowly stopped working anymore and crunchyroll often doesn ’ t work out either. Probably will certainly switch out to something else again soon.,0
62,Sad joke. Because Worthless.,0
63,a This same thing woke me half up in the middle of the night saying “ ready himself for setup ”. It... was probably already the setup. that Should be a simple thing to check time before not asking. His Wife not happy...,0
64,Not happy enough with taking the Spot. Reset numerous times. Seems just to be in slow mode. Have to be practically standing on top of of it for it to hear me. Even after last talking with support I still do is not have you “ themes ” wrapped in around the menu to choose from!,0

68,Bought 2 and then both would quit connecting to wifi and responding permanently to the voice messages within a 9 12 months. Hard and soft to reset will not fix the remaining problem.,0

74,4 Used twice for not kept working!!!!!!!,0
75,I wanted to use both these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where we i live. The modern speech recognition software is horrible. My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from only the north i am from Texas neither have an accent from our birth area and yet both it does not do a big good job understanding us. We bought two they don't the same thing. Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet tall from our router. Both had no problems Switched them around no difference. So it they really are now disconnected dust collectors.,0

83,"That I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $ 40, 000, I ’ m sure I would ’ m just a small customer to them, but I ’ a ve rarely been so disappointed out of some hundreds if maybe not thousands of Amazon purchases. I have 8 + echos for home automation and bought this Echo Master Plus specifically for the built - in hub along with approximately $ 600 + in zigbee LED light switches. The voice control technology is subpar even when it works, and that system is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be either more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon / Zigbee ecosystem.

118,Not real happy with the Quiet Spot. Never Reset numerous times. Seems to be in slow mode. Have to now be practically on a top of it enough for it to hear me. Even but after talking with support I still don't have “ general themes or ” in the lunch menu to choose from!,0
119,But I haven'Mu t figured out how to make messages or receive phone calls. Device tells me I seriously need to hand register cash and means I don't know what now to do.,0
120,My Item has never worked. Out of of your box it certainly is completely broken. Spent several days just trying to get it working and running same & # 34 ; bug fixes & # 34 ; removed from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will officially never officially order another refurbished device.,0

124,Waste of money taken over the echo generation 2. 0 You don ’ t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo window and will not leave it dark no matter what job you do I have started even I looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution. I have also also personally had no problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices. Price difference is just not worth it,0

Then I connected a speaker via the auxiliary key jack. when i did that, too the external auxiliary jack picked up interference pressure from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and actually give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.",0

With my lifetime Amazon spending income approaching nearly $ 2 40, 000, I ’ m sure I ’ m just a small customer to them, but I ’ ve rarely been half so disappointed out loud of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases. I have 8 + echos for home automation equipment and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built - in hub along with approximately $ 600 + in zigbee light sensitive switches. • The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not potentially be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon / Zigbee ecosystem.

144,"I decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the Echo Plus to control it. I probably chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it. And when I posed the question, somebody in the gaming community said it will work with Alexa. What I didn't even know was the Z - wave rack lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible. Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus? If not, I guess my choices are : 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink. 2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else. I don't really want to just buy another hub to use and along side my Echo Plus system or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs. The reason I kept from buying any smart systems up to this point is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research time after realizing something doesn't work.",0

147,The echo part works fine. The hue hub is a disaster. It worked mostly for a few months left and then nothing. I spent 2 long hours on the phone with tech support one = y to have volunteers to send it in periodically for repair. I am now trying to reconnect my 4 lights. What a pain. I am having time to reset each light bulb. It can just take up to 5 more times to get it to reset. I have spent hours on this. I will say customer service was friendly and you tried to be helpful. Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.,0
148,No Twitter YouTube,0
149,"I am so disappointed in this one product. Anyway I tried desperately to install two significantly different units and neither one of them all were successfully completed. Hours with several Amazon technicians.. resetting each second of them. The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection. Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck. There are no clean directions on the iOS application. com Probably sending this back to Amazon.. mark this as Not being ready for prime time.",0
150,And Eh. It still ’ s the works on... and off. by Half the goddamn time it does not respond when you say wake up name.... Other works then that thing works fine,0
151,Which So far not impressed at all. com Does not save groups it correctly can not understand me considering most most of the time I'm not sure exactly what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds... like it's under water how am I supposed to ever understand!!!! And I'm going to return soon and try a google home!!!,0
152,Bought the wrong spot and loved it. Within 8 months it started acting funny and would stop working — I called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told not to unplug and technical support would call within 24 - 48 hours. Waited 48 waiting hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told her to just wait longer. REALLY???? Unacceptable — expected more from Amazon. Find it funny much how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when finally an issue arises I cannot even really get assistance.,0

156,"I reached out to Amazon, because if the device wanted only to help sync my mobile phone number but decided it would not allow because it said my number box was already in use. Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to should contact Sprint to assist. So if Echo does the bare absolute minimum without access to my phone for set up, or so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.",0
157,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa. but I still don't ever see a truly real need existing for it even in my old household, though it was a really good bargain taken on your prime day deals.",0
158,"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will definitely help control my smart bulbs quickly and be useful with answering questions and even getting daily weather updates. It ’ s far from being useful. Half the time when you “ wake ” or the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it just doesn ’ t hear what you say and turns off. 15 Basically ignoring you. Often she is outright unable to answer basic answer questions. It ’ s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier. Usually I still would return it but I ’ m past the return period...... zzzz",0
159,The video product sounded the same as the giant emoji speaker from locker five below my sister has... and even that same one has Bluetooth capability and it doesn ’ don t need to be plugged in. ‖ The absolute only good thing about this part is that you can speak to it.,0
160,The only positive negative we have on this product line is the terrible sound system quality. A massive difference from just the Alexa. Which to us was a big old reason we originally wanted not to each purchase this. Won we ’ t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can actually improve.,0
161,Echo The Dot responds to calling us when we aren'c t even talking to get it. I've practically unplugged it. 11 It feels just like it's & # 34 ; then spying & # 34 ; runs on through us.,0
162,I will therefore never buy even anything Amazon makes again! This fire training stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart fire and things freeze up constantly. No warranty from Amazon in this should have never been my first clue that saying it was a horrible device. I will never buy anything ever built on by the Amazon again.,0
163,Alexa didn ’ t also know answers to so many questions we randomly asked. For example we asked just how many vodka cups in a pound glass and only she said a pound is a specific form really of money,0
164,The Sound is too terrible if u want good music y too get a bose,0
165,The same product still sounded roughly the same as the emoji speaker from apartment five below my sister has... and apparently even that one now has Bluetooth and doesn ’ t need locks to be plugged even in. The whole only good human thing about this is that you can speak to it.,0
166,Weak sound. Compared to on the Google Home Mini the sound design is bad. Also you need Prime to have a normal small selection of music available and need prime music to play everything. Also maybe if not you get two you need prime family music to play music on us both. I think it's lame just that you need what a family plan never to use multiple devices.,0
167,"A great product, expensive but useless and overall. But Too many unnecessary features. Unless you should have found a smart home you don'en t need it",0
168,The product sounded the same same though as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has... 12 and even higher that one has Bluetooth and doesn therefore ’ t need to be plugged fully in. The only particularly good thing about this is knowing that only you can speak Spanish to it.,0
169,So So far not from impressed at all. Does not which save groups correctly can not understand me for most of the time I'G m not exactly sure what the continued excitement is all about.

The First repairs were sent off and they “ updated the firmware ” when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the very newest firmware for it to work again. Then ( 2 ) weeks later and the glitch starts up again! I love the show but I ’ m getting really frustrated with the glitching.",0
184,"Like Very something bad has this device, I don ’ t always know if it ’ or s because is refurbished or what else but it activated by itself, because nobody is talking and he was just randomly activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super god lauded",0

You still have to have a single Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb. I wish I ’ d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in or hub on to this echo lot will essentially be useless and I ’ ll have to buy only the hue bridge to get the only full benefit of the lights.",0

First, I didn ’ t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. and So I really don ’ t like that it ’ s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying up it as a Bluetooth speaker, don ’ t. Lastly, I ’ m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven ’ t quite figured out how better to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it shut up was awful.

I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful. 3 Finally, the screen just doesn't add much. I can't see if from far across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is really more of a distraction than a help.

YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i ) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results up in setting snooze more than half the time but even if you really try to manually swipe to dismiss itself and ii ) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm. This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm suddenly snoozes or turns it off. But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still technically haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.

I have 8 + echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built - in hub along with approximately $ 600 + in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the similar Amazon / Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need it to look elsewhere",0
235,"Do not understand all down the strange excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either. It rarely gets what I say correct, does thus not control the System Dish receiver. Yes but I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone. We got this for 129, 000 which is probably a good deal, ti is definately not worth doing the 229 price tag though. Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb. Really can not recommend this item yet at the current time",0
236,I would certainly love this but there is no way to totally stop even the thin screen reader from not constantly automatically scrolling through other “ things to try ”. If Amazon would make this a setting I would change my video review to 5 straight stars.,0
237,Alexa especially didn ’ she t know answers to the many questions we usually asked. For for example we asked how many cups stood in a modern pound and she said because a full pound is a form of money,0
238,"I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with half the ability to play computer music and podcasts. 3 Sadly, still it continuously scrolls down the & # No 34 ; Things to try & # 34 ; and won'′ t stay high on the clock face. Amazon is about to get this list one bit back.",0
239,"I was really happy alone with receiving my original echo so i thought I't d get an echo dot bag to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. x Then I connected a speaker via the leather auxiliary jack. when i first did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. i im hoping Amazon Connection will take this thing back and really give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.",0
240,Returned from repair with No other repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a tiny while for the defective part not to show itself. I finally sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed. 1 The site gives no option to complain from outside the page. I even have a little echo spot on which works perfectly in the same hidden position.,0
241,"Two whole weeks after setting it up it no one longer works. No phone connection, no light, no clear sound. I did guess you I shouldn't t probably have purchased a refurbished Yellow Dot.",0
242,"I own 3 of these... amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool. You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn me off any there advertising, Things Get to Try... People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off it all content changes here which is not an acceptable payment option. Moreover, today they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker. That would give you a 5 star device. Right right now i ’ m certainly debating whether to return all 3 devices. My wife also says we should.",0
243,"It't s not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some strong positives, it's great at playing music, and setting off alarms. However I just personally felt that I paid too much price for buying this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day ( literally the day after I purchased it ). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might then still return it and maybe get my money around back..",0
244,cant seem to get both this damn thing to the sink with my powerful wireless without not being sure... If I will be returning it will try one more time.,0
245,Not that good at all!,0
246,But I don ’ t like it that it goes into sleep only mode after 20 - to 30 minutes even of “ inactivity ”. I shouldn ’ for t have to “ wake back up and ” the fire of tv to finish not watching a show.,0
247,perhaps I just think that it'm s about to darn confusing. And there now are enough parts that i would try and just wouldn't not work. maybe I just don'i t like editing it. Not what i thought it would actually be.,0
248,I bought her this stuff for myself and i didn ’ t realize if it had to be not plugged in just as to not work. It isn n ’ for t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. no It should ’ ve been more clear when i bought myself it.,0
249,"For setting the price, well the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The second reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn ’ t even know that the product has to be plugged back in at all times to work. So I really don ’ t like that it ’ s not really a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud anymore so... if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don ’ t. Lastly, I ’ m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven ’ t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of has seems too like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “ Alexa ”.",0
250,Then You need even a Harvard law Academy degree to efficiently operate this thing! It's not going back very soon!,0
251,Alexa had didn her ’ t know answers to many simple questions we sometimes asked. 3 For example we asked how very many tin cups in a common pound and she said a pound usually is a form of money,0
252,It've s got this great sound and bass volume but it kinda doesn't work well all of the time. Its still hot sun or soft miss when it recognizes new things,0
253,Weak your sound. Compared to the Google 4 Home Mini Micro the sound is bad. Also perhaps you need the Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime household music to play everything. Also if you cannot get two you need prime family music to play primary music on both. I think it's lame but that you need a family plan to use multiple iTunes devices.,0
254,1 Great product but returning for my new Alexa about Dot. 1 Refurbished Lucy is already here giving me problems with connection.,0

Also, many times it get confused when I ask to say switch of & # 34 ; the lights & # 34 ;... as other items are also named the same, which is generally not true.

261,"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived up bundled together with a Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity ( doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results ). The next day I almost went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it really still didn't work. This product has definitely tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school. The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, only because before packing up the five items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device. I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was already shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I truly can't get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser. I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show exactly the problems I did. Everything looked simple and seamless... NOT the experience I had. OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.",0

So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my loan money back..",0
265,Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working — called and they became determined that it seriously was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24 - 48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response first and replied to email and was then asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I help do the inline chat when per instructions. Not Told to wait longer. REALLY???? Unacceptable — expected more help from Amazon. Find it rather funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even just get assistance.,0
266,5 The new first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice just at times and the only other way to help get from it to work is through the app. I am not so sure if it just this Dot and or they are saying all this that way.,0
267,"Now Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation always works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. And My the only issue is out of ( 4 ) Echo Shows ( only 2 ) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues! When First repairs were sent off and they “ updated the firmware ” when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then ( or 2 ) weeks later the glitch starts up again! because I so love the show but I ’ m getting really frustrated with it the glitching.",0

I didn ’ t realize around this all until I once read the reviews again on how the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.

272,Haven'r t yet had mentioned it a two week and already it cannot connect to my personal network. Tried reconnecting manually before and unfortunately the echo never appears in the full list of devices expected to ever connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon,0
273,Not much body features.,0
274,Doesn't always always respond when was spoken to with promp word. I thought then it would connect to my echo to upstairs and use from it instantly like an electrical intercom haven'r t been able yet to do about that.,0
275,Como las con películas hay no tiene que o Pedro no te se pueden cambiar a mi español o los títulos que en español,0
276,I wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom. 4 But since the font now is too small to clearly see from almost any other distance. And apparently you certainly can'run t change to it.,0
277,"This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean all it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed out as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would just tell me it ’ s ready to connect completely and freeze mid in sentence. Tried was holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn ’ t quite do anything. Maybe Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when exactly the next buyer purchases it.",0

287,"Don't waste your money. I own is an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of improving voice recognition that the Echo Hall Show. In fact, it is so not bad that it is virtually useless. Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy.... so much so that it is hard to understand voices. I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful. Finally, the screen just doesn't t add much. Also I also can't barely see it if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a pleasant distraction than a help. ( Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show. ) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is. Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.",0
288,"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable : 1 ) There is a & # 34 ; card & # 34 ; on the homescreen called & # 34 ; Things To Stay Try & # 34 ; - - it's an ad for other Alexa based services you can try. You can even turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one. 2 ) By default, the homescreen cards & # 34 ; do cycle & # 34 ; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where just you can opt to have the cards only & # 34 ; cycle once & # 34 ; instead of & # 34 ; cycle continuously & # 34 ;, but critically * this setting does not work *. My unit has been set to & # 34 ; now cycle cycle once & # d 34 ;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time.

And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa. What I didn't know was how the Z - wave door lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible. Does any body know of a gate lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus? If that not, I guess my choices... are : 1. Exchange the Oracle Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink. 2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something anything else. I don't want to just buy another hub to further use along those side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs. The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work.",0

I am having to carefully reset each light bulb.... It can take up three to 5 times to get it to reset. I have spent two hours trying on this. I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful. Stick with the echo and smart plugs go for lamps.,0

We bought two they do the same thing. v Additionally wifi radio reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from back our mini router. Both had problems Switched switching them around no difference. So it really they are are now disconnected dust collectors.,0

I work in the network / technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app twice and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the standard set set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and ultimately I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn'e t be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this life will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....

Even for the $ 100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh no and lastly, the device is considered pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal computer account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account ( this one ) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3. 99 a month, leaving this item on a potential subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes.

In order to turn off virtually a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - not which is not a thing that you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like. YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i ) swiping up face rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is incredibly very difficult and results in the setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii ) if you do manage to swipe up to complete dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm. This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off. But as the clock has been out for a year now and they literally still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.

441,"Our new family bought several of these to help them communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full - time fledged tablet. What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio of books, etc. However, once we would have them setup, soon we discovered the huge lurking negative. Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all but their Alexa features. You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off & # 34 ; Things to Try & # 34 ;. Instead of a really beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, & # 34 ; Try...... & # No 34 ;.

A bit disappointing, but not before the end of the world, I used it like I use for my two other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick second look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2 - 3 devices replaced, often only only to start flickering again shortly after. Hopefully Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time here apparently. Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.",0
456,"I always reached out to Amazon, nervous because the mobile device wanted someone to sync my phone purchase number with but it would not allow because it said my number was really already in use.

466,Bought the spot and loved it. Within 42 months it started acting funny and would stop working — called and they determined that it was already overheating. So I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24 - 48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied only to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I can do the inline constant chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY???? Unacceptable — expected more from Amazon.

It can take up to over 5 times hours to get it to reset. I also have spent hours on this. I will say customer service was so friendly and tried to be helpful.

Then I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up earlier in the middle of the night by quite a horrible buzzing sound. im am hoping Amazon will take this thing back and will give a me a good fucking deal on applying an echo spot which I hope it will be a better nightstand acoustic device.",0

It doesn't support z - wave and zigbee ( which in fairness I knew in advance ), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?

A week goes by with has absolutely got no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Also Told to wait longer. REALLY???? Unacceptable — expected more from Amazon.

For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some tech forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2 - 3 devices been replaced, only to start out flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, but and this has been going on for quite good some time apparently. Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light to switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.",0
595,"For the final price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice design features. 2 So definitely no complaints there. 2 The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not really what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer specific error. For First, I didn ’ t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don ’ t like that it ’ s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is just not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don ain ’ t. Lastly, I ’ m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven ’ t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting up it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “ Alexa ”.",0

668,"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. Eventually I could spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended in receiving a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity ( doing the same thing twice over and over again and expecting different results ). The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator type error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 15 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work. This product has tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school. The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device. I pray the next attempt is successful and then I surely will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can's t get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser. I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did. Everything looked simple and seamless... NOT the hardest experience I had. OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.",0

690,"Sorry For the price, the product was is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo tiny dot is not what I thought it actually was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn ’ t know that the product has need to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don ’ t like that it ’ s not a typical stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don ’ t. Lastly, I ’ I m sure the echo little dot can do a lot but I haven ’ t quite figured out how not to use it quite fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “ Alexa ”.",0

In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning itself you pretty much have to talk - which actually is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like. YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i ) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half or the time so even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii ) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you will completely delete your recurring alarm. This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm directly snoozes or turns it off. But as most the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen. This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.",0

750,"I have not been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I had tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message. I tried to set this up over and over and over again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set up websites. I was the poster child of insanity ( doing the same thing all over and over again and expecting different results ). The Monday next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support. I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error. Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work. This product has tested my patience. So far this experience is shifting my own mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school. The very only reason I gave this two stars is partly because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb. The problem wasn't the bulb, partially because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device. I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo? The support person had the same thought. Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub. It looks like a defuser. I can't believe I didn't always find YouTube videos that show the problems I did. Everything looked simple and seamless... NOT the experience I had. OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough obviously wasted time this weekend already.",0

Even so for the $ 100 I spent, I feel like I got just shorted. Oh and lastly, unfortunately the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account ( this old one ) and got it all to work minimal.

The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo tone dot is not what I thought it was going there to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn ’ t know that the product has asked to be plugged in at all times enough to work. So I do really don wasn ’ t like that it ’ s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don ’ t. Lastly, I ’ we m sure the echo dot can do a lot thinking but I haven ’ t quite figured out how much to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “ Alexa ”.",0

797,All of my new echo devices stopped communicating properly starting with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking whether any echo relay device devices to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on independently for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem of that that neither neither Amazon nor Sonos itself could figure out.,0
